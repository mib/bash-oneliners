Useful one-line commands for Bash and basic GNU utilities
=========================================================

This is a collection of useful one-line commands for GNU/Linux and Bash. Some of them are rather unknown and/or hidden so well in manual pages that they deserve better propagation.

It's worth noting that some features are Bash-specific and won't work in other shells.
